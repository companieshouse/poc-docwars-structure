## Observations from POC
### Concerns
1. Storage of images (takes up space in git repo)
2. Storage of attachments (such as draw.io information for reproducibility)
3. No ability to write comments or like (likes arent widelty used in confluence)

### Aditional notes
1. Gone through the effort of copying confluence styling as close as I can. 
2. does a tool for exporting confluence pages to MD exist?
