The sequence of events depends on 2 things:

- What type of document are you generating i.e. HTML or PDF
- Do you want the generated document to be returned or stored in S3?

The above sequence diagram shows 3 potential exit points:

- Generate a HTML document and return it
- Generate a PDF document and return it
- Generate a HTML / PDF document and store it in S3
